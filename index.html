      QHP Provider/Formulary APIs: Sample Issuer Site
    </h1>
    <p>
      This site is a sample of how issuers could organize and make available their CMS-mandated data files. Please note that other than the format of the files, everything here is simply an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="cms-data-index.json">cms-data-index.json file</a> is the index data file. It lists the locations where other files can be found. <a href="index_document.md">More details on the index data file format</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="data/plans.json">plans.json</a> lists the plans for this issuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="data/providers.json">providers.json</a> lists the providers for all the plans for this issuer. Each provider is listed once and only once in the providers.json file; there is a mapping that allows the issuer to associate the provider with one or more plans in their network.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drugs.json files list the drugs covered by the issuer plans, and provides a mapping between each drug and the plans that cover that drug. In this example, there are two drugs.json files, <a href="data/drugs-1.json">drugs-1.json</a> and <a href="data/drugs-2.json">drugs-2.json</a>. They are both listed in the <a href="cms-data-index.json">cms-data-index.json file</a> so they can be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, the cms-data-index.json file is hosted in the root directory of the site. The various data files (plans.json, providers.json, drugs.json) are hosted in the data/ subdirectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is acceptable to serve the json files as text/plain, it is preferrable to set your web server to associate the application/json MIME type with the .json file extension, if it is not already set to that by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on the format of the various files, see the <a href="developer/index.html">developer documentation</a>.
